"""An Agenda is a list-like container of Appt (appointment).

   Author: FIXME for CIS 210, U. Oregon

   Each Appt has a date, a start time, an end time, and
   a textual description.   They can be converted to and
   from strings, using the from_string class method and the __str__
   method.  An Agenda can be read from a file using the
   from_file class method.  Intersecting Agendas produces
   a new Agenda whose Appts are periods that are in the overlap
   of Appts in the first and second Agenda.
